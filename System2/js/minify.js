/**
 * CSS Minification Helper
 * 
 * This script provides guidelines for minifying CSS.
 * For a real project, you would use a task runner like Gulp or Webpack.
 * 
 * Instructions for developers:
 * 
 * 1. For local development:
 *    - Use the regular CSS files (styles.css and themes.css)
 *    - Keep them readable and well-commented
 * 
 * 2. For production:
 *    - Use a CSS minifier tool (recommended tools: https://cssminifier.com/ or https://www.toptal.com/developers/cssminifier)
 *    - Combine and minify CSS files into a single file called styles.min.css
 *    - In the header.php file, uncomment the minified CSS import and comment out the regular CSS files
 * 
 * Manual Minification Steps:
 * 1. Copy all code from styles.css and themes.css
 * 2. Run through a minifier tool
 * 3. Save the output to css/styles.min.css
 * 4. In includes/header.php, update stylesheet links

// Example of how CSS import would look in header.php for production:
// <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.min.css">
// <!-- Regular CSS files commented out for production -->
// <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"> -->
// <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/themes.css"> -->
